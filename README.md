# jleechanclaw

Tools, scripts, and configuration for **jleechanclaw** — an autonomous orchestrator agent that replaces Jeffrey as the day-to-day operator across all jleechanorg projects.

## What This Is

This repo is the support layer for an OpenClaw agent named **jleechanclaw**. The agent manages fleets of coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor), monitors their work, handles PR lifecycle, and only escalates when human judgment is truly needed.

Inspired by the [Zoe pattern](https://x.com/eRvissun) — a one-person dev team where the orchestrator holds all business context and delegates specialized coding work to a fleet of agents.

### The Two-Tier Principle

Context windows are zero-sum. Fill it with code and there's no room for business context. Fill it with customer history and there's no room for the codebase.

**jleechanclaw** (orchestrator) holds business context: project goals, roadmaps, past decisions, what worked, what failed. Coding agents hold code context: files, tests, types. Each agent is loaded with exactly what it needs.

## Quick Start

### 1. Orchestration CLI

```bash
# Install the orchestration library
pip install jleechanorg-orchestration

# Spawn a Claude Code agent for a task
ai_orch run --agent-cli claude "Fix flaky integration tests and open PR"

# Spawn Codex for backend work
ai_orch run --agent-cli codex "Refactor auth middleware"

# Multi-agent with fallback chain
ai_orch run --agent-cli gemini,claude "Investigate failing CI in PR #42"

# Analyze a task and create agents
ai_orch dispatcher create --agent-cli claude "Fix PR review blockers"
```

### 2. Backup

```bash
# One-time backup
./scripts/backup-openclaw-full.sh

# Install scheduled backups (launchd)
./scripts/install-openclaw-backup-jobs.sh
```

### 3. OpenClaw Gateway

```bash
# Check health
./health-check.sh

# API test
curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:18789/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCLAW_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent":"main","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

### 4. Cron integration location (this repo)

- Tracked cron jobs live in: `openclaw-config/cron/jobs.json`
- The Genesis weekly curation job is defined there as:
  - `id: genesis-memory-curation-weekly`
  - schedule: `0 22 * * 0` (`America/Los_Angeles`)
- Runtime execution uses OpenClaw's scheduler + agent runtime, so **the OpenClaw gateway must be running**.
- **Important:** `openclaw-config/cron/jobs.json` is tracked source config; sync it to `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` for runtime pickup.

Quick verify:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
jq '.jobs[] | select(.id=="genesis-memory-curation-weekly")' openclaw-config/cron/jobs.json
# Optional runtime check (after sync):
jq '.jobs[] | select(.id=="genesis-memory-curation-weekly")' ~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json
```

## Agent Selection Guide

| Task Type | Agent | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Backend logic, complex bugs, multi-file refactors | Codex | Deep reasoning, thorough, low false-positive rate |
| Frontend, git operations, fast iteration | Claude Code | Faster, fewer permission issues, broad context |
| UI design, dashboard specs, creative | Gemini | Design sensibility — Gemini designs, Claude builds |
| Rapid prototyping, IDE-integrated | Cursor | Tight IDE integration |

## How jleechanclaw Operates

1. **Receives work** — from Jeffrey, from GitHub notifications, from scanning failing CI
2. **Plans tasks** — breaks work into focused pieces, selects the right agent for each
3. **Spawns agents** — via `ai_orch run` with precise prompts containing full business context
4. **Monitors progress** — CI status, PR reviews, agent health
5. **Handles failures** — diagnoses why an agent failed, writes a better prompt, retries (max 3)
6. **Delivers results** — notifies Jeffrey when PRs are ready to merge
7. **Learns** — logs what worked, what didn't, refines future prompts
