Trapping Rain Water - LeetCode Hard #42

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) using two-pointer approach

    Calculate trapped rain water using the two-pointer technique.

    At each position, water level = min(max_left, max_right) - height[i].
    Two pointers converge from both ends, tracking running maxes.
    We always advance the pointer with the smaller max, because the
    water at that side is bounded by its own max (the other side is
    guaranteed to be at least as tall).
